# TDD-Kata

This project demonstrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a focus on using JUnit for writing and running test cases.
The primary goal is to develop a `StringCalculator` class, which is implemented in the `StringCalculator.java` file. The
corresponding unit tests are written in the `StringCalculatorTest.java` file.

## Technology Used

- **Maven**
- **JUnit**

## Project Structure

- `StringCalculator.java`: Contains the implementation of the `StringCalculator` class.
- `StringCalculatorTest.java`: Contains the JUnit test cases to verify the functionality of the `StringCalculator`
  class.
